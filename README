**What is Customer Churn**
- Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service.
- The telecommunications business has an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in this highly competitive market.
- Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers.
- To detect early signs of potential churn, one must first develop a holistic view of the customers and their interactions across numerous channels, including store/branch visits, product purchase histories, customer service calls, 
Web-based transactions, and social media interactions, to mention a few.
